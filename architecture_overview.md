# Architecture Overview

## 1. Frontend

- **Framework:** The project is built using Next.js, enabling fast and efficient web application development with support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing flexibility in design and responsiveness.
- **Components:** The application follows a modular component structure, incorporating components such as `Header`, `Sidebar`, and `DefaultLayout` to maintain UI consistency across the application.

## 2. Backend

- **API:** The application communicates between the frontend and backend via an API. The API is responsible for authentication, data retrieval, and user state management.
- **Database:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the code, it is assumed that the project is connected to a database to store user data, products, and other relevant information.

## 3. State Management

- **Context API:** The application utilizes Context API for global state management, including user data and authentication status, ensuring seamless access to data across components.

## 4. Routing

- **Next.js Routing:** The application leverages Next.js' file-based routing system, allowing easy navigation between pages.

## 5. Testing

- **Linting and Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier are used to maintain code quality and formatting consistency.

## Assumptions

1. **Users:** It is assumed that users have basic knowledge of web applications and can interact with a complex user interface.
2. **Connectivity:** Users are expected to have a stable internet connection to access the application and interact with the API.
3. **Security:** The API used for authentication and data management is assumed to be well-protected against unauthorized access.
4. **Scalability:** The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing new features and components to be added without disrupting the existing structure.
5. **Responsiveness:** The application is expected to be accessed from various devices, including desktops and mobile devices, making responsive design a key consideration.
6. **Documentation:** Adequate documentation is assumed to be provided for other developers who may work on the project in the future.
